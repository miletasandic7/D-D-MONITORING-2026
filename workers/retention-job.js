/**
 * Retention job (Phase 3).
 *
 * Deletes recordings past their retention_expires_at: removes the
 * object from storage first, then the DB row -- in that order, so a
 * crash between the two leaves an orphaned storage object (cheap to
 * find and clean up later) rather than a DB row pointing at nothing.
 *
 * This is a standalone script meant to run on a schedule (cron, a
 * Vercel Cron Job hitting a thin wrapper, systemd timer, etc.) rather
 * than as a long-running process like the recording worker -- it does
 * one pass and exits, which fits Vercel Cron / any scheduler cleanly.
 *
 * Uses queryAsPlatformAdmin (Phase 6 RLS bypass) throughout: retention
 * applies across every organization's recordings, not one tenant's --
 * a trusted background process, not a user-facing request.
 *
 * Run with: node workers/retention-job.js
 * Required env: DATABASE_URL, STORAGE_* (see api/_storage.js)
